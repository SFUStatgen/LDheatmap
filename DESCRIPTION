Suggests: rtracklayer, GenomicRanges, GenomeInfoDb,  IRanges, lattice, ggplot2
Description: Produces a graphical display, as a heat map, of measures
        of pairwise linkage disequilibria between SNPs. Users may
        optionally include the physical locations or genetic map
        distances of each SNP on the plot. Users should note that the
        imported package snpStats and the suggested packages 
        rtracklayer, GenomicRanges, GenomInfoDb and IRanges are all
        BioConductor packages <https://bioconductor.org>.
